incase i need to switch drives
---
seems like I do
currently planning to switch from my 250 drive to 450 drive, soft switch so it'll be less bloated but heopfully i can configure everything I need. 
afterwards i'd like to install windows 10 on my 250 drive. Configure my games League of Legends, I guess just that for now.
